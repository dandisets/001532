description: 'This dataset contains recordings of neural activity using two-photon
  calcium imaging from the mouse primary visual cortex (VISp). The mice had GCaMP8s
  expressed in their inhibitory interneurons (Slc32a1). The experiments were conducted
  using the same data collection pipeline as the Allen Brain Observatory (de Vries
  et al., Nature Neurosci., 2020), with an improved microscopy system that uses multi-plane
  imaging. A running wheel was used to track locomotion. The recordings were performed
  during two different visual stimulus sets: 1. STAGE_0: Natural movie clips. 2. STAGE_1:
  Drifting gratings presented as full-field stimuli (approximately 120x90 degrees
  of visual space). These gratings were presented in 8 directions, at 5 contrasts
  (5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 80%), as well as 8 directions, and 5 temporal frequencies (0.5,
  1, 2, 4, 8 Hz). This dataset also includes the gene expression tables associated
  with subsets of neurons in the neural recording dataset. The gene expression was
  quantified using HCR (Hybridization Chain Reaction) method and multiple rounds of
  multichannel lightsheet imaging. Transcriptomic data in available in a Github repository:
