description: 'This dataset contains recordings of neural activity using two-photon
  calcium imaging from the mouse primary visual cortex (VISp). The mice had GCaMP6f
  expressed in their inhibitory interneurons (Gad2). The experiments were conducted
  using the same data collection pipeline as the Allen Brain Observatory (de Vries
  et al., Nature Neurosci., 2020), with an improved microscopy system that uses multi-plane
  imaging. A camera-based eye tracking system and running wheel were used to track
  pupil dynamics and locomotion. The recordings were performed during two different
  visual stimulus sets: 1. STAGE_0: Natural movie clips. 2. STAGE_1: Drifting gratings
  presented as full-field stimuli (approximately 120x90 degrees of visual space).
  These gratings were presented in 8 directions, at 5 contrasts (5%, 10%, 20%, 40%,
  80%), as well as 8 directions, and 5 temporal frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 Hz).'
